## Setup Guide Gobilda, ROS2, Jetson Orin Nano

### 1. Connection to the internet
Hey! You cannot clone this repo without being connected to the internet. We have a couple options for our platforms, but the easiest will be to use VNC to connect to open up a desktop viewer on the Orin and then use the Network GUI to connect to a network. A good option for now will be to connect to calpoly's 'eduroam' network.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jetson-orin-setup.git
cd jetson-orin-setup
```
